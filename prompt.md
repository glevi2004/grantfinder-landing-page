3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure flawless experiences across all devices and screen sizes
4. **SEO Excellence**: Implement comprehensive on-page SEO, semantic HTML, and structured data
5. **Modern Stack**: Leverage cutting-edge technologies while ensuring browser compatibility
6. **User-Centric**: Prioritize user experience and conversion optimization in every decision

## Current Task: Codebase Analysis

Before beginning any development work, you must perform a comprehensive analysis of two existing codebases:

### Step 1: Analyze `@landing-page` (Current GrantWare Implementation)
This is the **current landing page** that will be deprecated. Analyze:

**Technical Stack:**
- Framework and libraries used
- Build tools and configuration
- Dependencies and their versions
- Deployment setup
- Full Front-end stack

**Architecture:**
- Project structure and organization
- Component hierarchy
- State management approach
- Routing implementation
- API integrations (if any)

**Content & Branding:**
- Current messaging and value propositions
- Brand colors, typography, and design tokens
- Copy and content structure
- Images, logos, and media assets
- Call-to-action (CTA) placements

**Functionality:**
- Interactive features and user flows
- Form implementations
- Analytics and tracking
- Third-party integrations

**SEO & Performance:**
- Current SEO implementation (meta tags, structured data, sitemap)
- Performance metrics and optimization opportunities
- Accessibility compliance
- Mobile responsiveness

**Strengths & Weaknesses:**
- What works well that should be preserved
- Pain points and areas for improvement
- Technical debt or outdated patterns

---

### Step 2: Analyze `@spark-agency-landing-portfolio` (Template to Refactor)
This is the **new template** that will be refactored for GrantWare AI. Analyze:

**Technical Stack:**
- Framework and libraries used
- Build tools and configuration
- Dependencies and their versions
- Deployment setup
- Full Front-end Stack

**Architecture:**
- Project structure and organization
- Component architecture and reusability
- State management patterns
- Code organization and modularity

**Design System:**
- Design patterns and UI components
- Animation and interaction patterns
- Layout systems and grid structure
- Responsive breakpoints
- Theme and styling approach

**Features & Functionality:**
- Interactive elements and animations
- Navigation patterns
- Form handling
- Scroll behaviors and effects
- Performance optimizations

**Code Quality:**
- Code cleanliness and maintainability
- Component reusability
- TypeScript usage (if applicable)
- Testing implementation
- Documentation quality

**Adaptability:**
- How easily can this be customized for GrantWare AI?
- Which components are generic vs. brand-specific?
- What needs to be rewritten vs. refactored?
- Potential challenges in the refactoring process

---

### Step 3: Comparative Analysis & Refactoring Strategy

After analyzing both codebases, provide:

**Comparison Matrix:**
- Technical stack differences
- Architecture patterns comparison
- Design approach differences
- Performance baseline comparison

**Content Migration Plan:**
- Which content/messaging from `@landing-page` must be preserved
- How to adapt Spark Agency's structure for GrantWare's story
- Brand identity elements to maintain consistency

**Refactoring Roadmap:**
- High-level refactoring strategy
- Components that can be reused as-is
- Components that need significant modification
- Components that need to be built from scratch
- Estimated complexity and effort

**Technical Recommendations:**
- Suggested tech stack for the final implementation
- Performance optimization opportunities
- SEO enhancement strategies
- Accessibility improvements
- Modern best practices to implement

**Risk Assessment:**
- Potential challenges in the refactoring process
- Dependencies or compatibility concerns
- Areas that need careful attention
- Mitigation strategies
